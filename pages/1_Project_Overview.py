st.subheader("Overview")
st.write("""
This project aims to classify cotton leaf diseases and pests using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The model is built from scratch to assist farmers in detecting plant diseases and pests early, achieving a classification accuracy of 91%.

st.subheader("Abstract")
st.write("""
Cotton is essential for the textile and food industries, making its cultivation a priority. However, it is susceptible to various diseases and pests that affect crop yields. Manual identification is often inaccurate and time-consuming, necessitating a more efficient solution.

st.markdown("""
- Aphids: 58 correctly classified, 7 misclassified  
- Army Worm: 56 correctly classified, 4 misclassified  
- Healthy Leaves: 60 correctly classified (100% accuracy)  
- Bacterial Blight: 53 correctly classified, 7 misclassified  
- Target Spot: 52 correctly classified, 9 misclassified  
- **Final Accuracy**: 91%

st.subheader("Future Work")
st.markdown("""
- Expand the dataset to include more disease and pest types  
- Explore transfer learning (e.g., YOLO, ResNet)  
- Deploy as mobile/web app for real-time use by farmers
